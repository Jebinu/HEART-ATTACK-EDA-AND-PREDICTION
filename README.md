# HEART-ATTACK-EDA-AND-PREDICTION
My project can help predict the people who are likely to diagnose with a heart disease by help of their medical history. To predict this, we use 14 medical attributes of a patients and classify them if the patient is likely to have a heart disease. These medical attributes are trained under various algorithms. Most efficient of these algorithms is Logistic Regression which gives us the accuracy of 83.93%  . And, finally we classify patients that are at risk of getting a heart disease or not and also this method is totally cost efficient.
